- welcome to the future of design selections, Trender!
- what is swarm intelligence, anyway?
- it is a method of understanding user adoption patterns, and what drives them
- according to the predictive market theory, 
	- we can make astute bets on what designs will be popular in the future
- Trender lets you observe swarms of designs and trends over time,
- This is live, and it takes in user input of design liked/disliked, 
	- runs the flocking algorithm on it, and assigns it to a particular swarm
	- based on similar tags
- visually, we have two stunning interfaces,
	- an iOS frontend that lets users like/dislike a particular design
	- a web-view modal of a force-layout chart that lets you *interact* with individual designs
- Predictive markets are the future, no pun intended, and:
	- They will let the group consensus of designers lead the way to discover trending designs
- So, when in doubt, observe the trend!
- Trender!
